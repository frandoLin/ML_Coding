# Classic Machine Learning Algorithms implemented in NumPy

This repository contains clean and educational implementations of classic machine learning algorithms using only **NumPy**, with no external ML libraries. These models are designed to help you understand how popular algorithms work under the hood â€” ideal for interviews, learning, and experimentation.

## What's Inside

| `multi_logistic.py` | Multiclass Logistic Regression (Softmax Classifier) |
| `kmeans.py` | KMeans clustering |
| `naive_bayes_classifier.py` | Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier |
| `svm.py` | Linear Support Vector Machine (Hinge Loss) |
| `pca.py` | Principal Component Analysis (PCA) |
| `simple_nn.py` | 1-Hidden Layer Neural Network (Softmax Output) |
